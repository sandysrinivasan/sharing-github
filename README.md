Binder link to the data-exploration notebook - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sandysrinivasan/sharing-jupyter/master 

Need to update link after adding files, as the container created when making the Binder link is not updated automatically with Github commits. Link is unique to the repo or branch or notebook and is always named the same, but can be rebuilt to update changes.

Built and rebuilt on website - http://mybinder.org
