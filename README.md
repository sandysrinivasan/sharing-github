Binder link to the data-exploration notebook - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sandysrinivasan/sharing-jupyter/master 

Link after adding requirements.txt - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sandysrinivasan/sharing-jupyter/master 

Link after adding data file - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sandysrinivasan/sharing-jupyter/master 

Need to update link after adding files, as the container created when making the Binder link is not updated automatically with Github commits.
